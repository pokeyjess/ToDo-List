# React To Do list

Keep track of your "to do" list while on the go! This application was created as an assignment during my time at Kenzie Academy.

## Simple design

This is meant to be a simple application, with a no-frills, elegant design.

The application allows you to create and manage a list of "to do" items. Add new items, mark off ones already completed, and, when you are ready, clear the completed items from the main list. Separate lists organize items by "active" and "completed."

## Instructions

To run this application on your own machine, fork and clone the repo. You'll want to run "npm install," and "npm start" to fire up your local server.

Enjoy!
